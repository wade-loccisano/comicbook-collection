# comicbook-collection

Fullstack application that stores user information in a SQL database, calls Marvel's API for comic book information, and presents it all in stylized webpages.

Final Capstone made for Tech Elevator Coding Bootcamp.

# What I Learned

* Implemented Vue.js framework to create the front-end portion of the application.
* Used Axios to make calls to Marvel's comic book API for dynamic information about your favorite superheroes.
* Used back-end routing in Java (SpringBoot) to allow users to store collection and comic information in a SQL database.
